# Connector Plugins

A connector plugin adds a **data source or sink Ciaren doesn't support in
core** — an internal REST API, a niche database, a proprietary warehouse, an
object store. Once installed and approved:

- it appears as a card on the **Connections** page (in a *From plugins*
  section, with a Plugin badge);
- its connection form is **driven by your metadata** — the standard flags
  (host/port, auth) plus any fields you declare in `config_schema`;
- connections can be **tested**, and their tables/objects **listed**;
- flows read it through the standard **SQL Input** node (sql-ish kinds) or
  **Storage Input** node (storage kind), and write through the matching output
  nodes — Ciaren materializes frames to parquet snapshots exactly as it does
  for built-in databases.

This is the intended path for most new integrations. The open core keeps a small
set of broadly useful connectors; product-specific, internal, or long-tail
systems should be packaged as plugins instead of proposed as built-in core
connectors.

::: tip Generic HTTP APIs are already covered in core
Ciaren ships a built-in [REST API connector](/guide/connections#web-apis) with
auth, headers, pagination, and parsing options — you don't need a plugin to
read a JSON/CSV API. Build a connector plugin when you need something the
generic connector can't express: a proprietary wire protocol, a niche database
driver, a SaaS product's specific API shape, or write support.
:::

The code below sketches a minimal connector for an internal service; the
[core REST API connector's source](https://github.com/ciaren-labs/Ciaren/blob/main/backend/app/connectors/rest_api.py)
is a fuller reference for request handling, auth, and pagination patterns.

## The two halves: spec + runtime

A connector is a `ConnectorSpec` (catalog + form metadata) plus a
`ConnectorRuntime` (behavior), both registered by a `ConnectorProvider`:

```python
from app.plugin_api import (
    ConnectorProvider, ConnectorRuntime, ConnectorSpec, ConnectorTestResult, Permission,
)

class InventoryRuntime(ConnectorRuntime):
    def test(self, config) -> ConnectorTestResult:
        ...  # cheap reachability/auth check

    def list_tables(self, config) -> list[dict]:
        return [{"name": t, "schema": None, "row_count": None} for t in ("stock", "warehouses")]

    def read(self, config, options):     # REQUIRED — returns a pandas DataFrame
        table = options.get("table") or options.get("path")
        ...

class InventoryConnectorProvider(ConnectorProvider):
    def connectors(self):
        return [
            ConnectorSpec(
                id="acme-inventory",
                label="Acme Inventory",
                kind="sql",                       # sql-ish → readable via SQL Input
                provider="acme.inventory-connector",
                permissions=(Permission.network, Permission.credentials),
                metadata={"needs_host": True, "needs_auth": True, "supports_query": False},
                config_schema={"fields": [
                    {"key": "site_id", "label": "Site", "type": "string", "required": True},
                    {"key": "include_archived", "type": "boolean", "default": False},
                ]},
            )
        ]

    def connector_implementations(self):
        return {"acme-inventory": InventoryRuntime()}
```

### What `config` and `options` contain

The runtime never touches the database row or the ORM. Ciaren flattens the
saved connection into a plain mapping per call:

```python
config = {
  "host": …, "port": …, "database": …, "username": …,
  "password": …,   # resolved from the connection's env var for this ONE call
  "options": {...} # your config_schema fields land here
}
```

`options` on `read`/`write` carries the flow node's config — `mode`/`table`/
`schema`/`query` from a SQL node, `path`/`format` from a storage node — plus
`limit` for bounded preview reads (apply it if your source can, Ciaren enforces
it afterwards regardless).

### Choosing a `kind`

| `kind` | Listed under | Readable via | Writable via |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `"sql"`, `"api"`, anything not below | Databases (SQL nodes) | **SQL Input** (`list_tables` + `read`) | **SQL Output** (`write`) |
| `"storage"` | Storage nodes | **Storage Input** (`list_objects` + `read`) | **Storage Output** (`write`) |
| `"mlflow"` | Experiment tracking | — | — |

Only `read` is required. Optional methods you don't implement surface in the
UI/API as a clear *"not supported by this connector"* message — never a 500.

## Secrets

Ciaren's rule is **env-var-only secrets** and plugin connectors inherit it: the
connection stores the *name* of an environment variable; the resolved value is
passed into your runtime's `config["password"]` for the duration of one call.
Never persist it. If you need more than one secret, take env-var *names* as
`config_schema` fields (mark them `"secret": true` so they render masked) and
resolve them with `os.environ` yourself — document that clearly.

## Security model

- Your runtime only becomes reachable after the user **approved** the plugin
  and granted its manifest permissions (`network`, `credentials`,
  `database_access`, …) — gated plugins are never even imported.
- The host runs its **SSRF guard** on the connection's `host` field before
  invoking your runtime (when `CONNECTOR_BLOCK_PRIVATE_HOSTS` is enabled), the
  same guard the core connectors use.
- Failures in your runtime surface as clean connection-test failures or 400s;
  a broken plugin can't crash the connections API.

Remember the honest boundary: permissions are a **disclosure and gating
mechanism**, not a sandbox — approved plugin code runs with the server's
access. See [Plugin Security & Permissions](/security/plugin-security).

## When to open an issue

Open a core issue when:

- an existing built-in connector or plugin API behavior is broken;
- the Plugin SDK is missing a capability needed to implement a connector safely;
- the docs are unclear or an example is wrong.

For "please support service X" requests, start in GitHub Discussions and treat
the work as a community plugin unless maintainers explicitly accept it into
core.

## Try it

Install a connector plugin from the Plugins page (or drop one into
`CIAREN_PLUGINS_DIR`) and approve it. On the **Connections** page its card
appears under *From plugins*; fill the form it declares, test, and save. In a
flow, add **SQL Input** (or **Storage Input** for storage kinds), choose the
connection, and pick a table/endpoint. For plain HTTP APIs, reach for the
built-in [REST API connector](/guide/connections#web-apis) first.
